# Mall-Customer-Segmentation

This project uses unsupervised learning to perform customer segmentation based on mall shopping data. A K-Means clustering model was developed that successfully identifies 5 distinct and interpretable customer personas—such as 'VIP Customers' and 'Frugal Spenders'—achieving a high Silhouette Score of 0.89.

The repository also includes a comparative analysis with DBSCAN (which performed poorly on this dataset) and a feature for classifying new customers into these defined segments, making it suitable for targeted marketing applications.
